We study thermodynamic, structural and electronic properties of classical and fermionic liquids, complex and confined liquids are studied. The characterization of thermal and dielectric properties of tissues of biological interest, and dynamic and structural properties of systems composed of granular matter, are also addressed.

The group has several researchers, thesis students and scholarship holders, who carry out basic and applied research activities, using theoretical, computational and experimental tools.

Some of the interest that guide our research: 

1. Statistical mechanics of classical and quantum liquids
2. Structure of confined liquids 
3. Structural and dynamic properties of proteins
4. Dielectric and thermal properties of tissues of biomedical interest
5. Dynamic systems
6. Granular Media Physics
