abstract: We present simulation results for an intruder pulled through a two-dimensional
  granular system by a spring using a model designed to mimic the experiments described
  by Kozlowski et al. [Phys. Rev. E 100, 032905 (2019)]. In that previous study the
  presence of basal friction between the grains and the base was observed to change
  the intruder dynamics from clogging to stick-slip. Here we first show that our simulation
  results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data for a variety of experimentally
  accessible friction coefficients governing interactions of particles with each other
  and with boundaries. We then use simulations to explore a broader range of parameter
  space, focusing on the friction between the particles and the base. We consider
  both static and dynamic basal friction coefficients, which are difficult to vary
  smoothly in experiments. The simulations show that dynamic friction strongly affects
  the stick-slip behavior when the coefficient is decreased below 0.1, while static
  friction plays only a marginal role.
