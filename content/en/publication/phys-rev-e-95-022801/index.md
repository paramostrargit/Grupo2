abstract: We performed extensive simulations of the random-bond Ising model confined
  between walls where competitive surface fields act. By properly taking the thermodynamic
  limit we unambiguously determined wetting transition points of the system, as extrapolation
  of localization-delocalization transitions of the interface between domains of different
  orientation driven by the respective fields. The finite-size scaling theory for
  wetting with short-range fields [E. V. Albano and K. Binder, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109,
  036101 (2012)] establishes that the average magnetization of the sample, with critical
  exponent $β$, is the proper order parameter for the study of wetting. While the
  hyperscaling relationship given by $γ + 2β = ν_∥ + ν_⊥$ requires $β = 1/2 (γ = 4,
  ν_∥ = 3, and ν_⊥ = 2)$, the thermodynamic scaling establishes that $Δ_s = γ + β$,
  which in contrast requires $β=0 (Δ_s = 4)$, where $γ, ν_∥, ν_⊥ and Δ_s$ are the
  critical exponents of the susceptibility, the correlation lengths parallel and perpendicular
  to the interface, and the gap exponent, respectively. So, we formulate a finite-size
  scaling theory for wetting without hyperscaling and perform numerical simulations
  that provide strong evidence of hyperscaling violation (i.e., $β = 0$) and a direct
  measurement of the susceptibility critical exponent $γ / ν_⊥ = 2.0 ± 0.2$, in agreement
  with theoretical results for the strong fluctuation regime of wetting transitions
  with quenched noise.
