abstract: 'We use the Monte Carlo simulation technique to study the critical behavior
  of a three-state spin model, with bilinear and biquadratic nearest-neighbor interactions,
  known as the Blume–Emery–Griffiths model (BEG), in a square lattice. In order to
  characterize this model, we study the phase diagram, in which we identify three
  different phases: ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and quadrupolar, the later with one
  sublattice filled with spins and the other with vacancies. We perform our studies
  by using two algorithms: Metropolis update (MU) and Wang–Landau (WL). The critical
  scaling behavior of the model is complementary studied by applying results obtained
  by using both algorithms, while tricritical points and the tricritical scaling behavior
  is analyzed by means of WL measuring the joint density of states and using the method
  of field mixing in conjunction with finite-size scaling. Furthermore, motivated
  by the decoupling between spins observed within the quadrupolar phase, we further
  generalize the BEG model in order to study the behavior of the system by adding
  a next nearest neighbour (NNN) interaction between spins. We found that by increasing
  the strength of the (ferromagnetic) NNN interaction, a new ferromagnetic phase takes
  over that contains both quadrupolar and ferromagnetic order.'
